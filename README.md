This project is all about making a cookie clicker from scratch. You could aske yourself what's a cookie clicker ? You can see a brieve example [here](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). The goal of this type of game is easy, make as much cookie you can imagine. How ? By clicking on a button/image/wathever you decide to make people click on. It's all about the good old capitalism, more cookie you have, more cookie you can produce by buying types of multiplicators. 

For this project we have guidelines divide in steps :

1. Base structure
2. Prepare the javascript
3. Increase the score
4. Make a multiplier
5. Price of multiplier
6. No credit
7. Display multiple counter
8. Increase the cost
9. Display the cost
10. Auto-clicker
11. Bonus 
12. Deactivate the buttons
13. Make it pretty 

You can see all the details of those steps [here](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXL-Swartz-4-27/blob/master/2.The-Hill/1.Javascript/cookieClicker.md).

## Project Managing

How the team work ?

The project manager (Etienne) split the team in two. One person leading the frontend (Guillaume) and one person leading the backend (Nicolas). Every morgning, afternoon and evening we had a 15minutes breefing talking about what has been done, what were the difficulties, how did we pass the difficulties and what has to be done next. In this manner it was super easy to understand how each person in the group feel and how we can track the negative of the positive feeling in the group.

The project manager split the tasks in smaller task in the product backlog and assign tasks to the Front and Back leader.
