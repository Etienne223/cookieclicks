This project is all about making a cookie clicker from scratch. You could aske yourself what's a cookie clicker ? You can see a brieve example [here](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). The goal of this type of game is easy, make as much cookie you can imagine. How ? By clicking on a button/image/wathever you decide to make people click on. It's all about the good old capitalism, more cookie you have, more cookie you can produce by buying types of multiplicators. 

For this project we have guidelines divide in steps :

1. Base structure
2. Prepare the javascript
3. Increase the score
4. Make a multiplier
5. Price of multiplier
6. No credit
7. Display multiple counter
8. Increase the cost
9. Display the cost
10. Auto-clicker
11. Bonus 
12. Deactivate the buttons
13. Make it pretty 

You can see all the details of those steps [here](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXL-Swartz-4-27/blob/master/2.The-Hill/1.Javascript/cookieClicker.md).

## Project Managing

How the team work ?

The project manager (Etienne) split the team in two. One person leading the frontend (Guillaume) and one person leading the backend (Nicolas). 
Every morgning, afternoon and evening we had a 15minutes breefing in order to talk about what has been done, what were the difficulties, how did we pass the difficulties and what has to be done next.

In this way it was super easy to understand how each person in the group feel and how we can track the negative of the positive feeling in the group plus the difficulties that we could encounter.

The fact that we worked in pair was also a really good deal because two heads are always better than one. 

The first two days of the challenge we worked mostly frontend team on their side and backend on the other side. We used the pair coding technique to and relay each other to overcome difficulties. Still we were available for any questions in the group if needed. The last day was the day were we merge all our work and where all the problems could happen. However we achieve to make "Cookie Kisser" work. 

The project manager split the tasks in smaller task in the kanban and assign tasks to the Front and Back leader. For the frontend we use the "Mobile first" concept.
